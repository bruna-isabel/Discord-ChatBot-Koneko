# ChatBot-Koneko

  I completed this project with four other classmates, in my first year of University. Koneko bot is a Discord Chatbot programmed in Python that has many functionalities. It works as a translator, it tells you the weather, it works as a dictionary, it works as a locator and it has a profanity decryptor. 
  I created the locator function, which makes the bot tell you, for example, restaurants in London. It shows up to twenty results, showing the restaurant’s name, rating, address, contact, the opening hours and if it’s open at the moment. 
  The Chatbot received good feedback and the team received a mark of 92% for the project. This project helped me develop Python programming skills and I learnt to organize my time more, by working with others.
