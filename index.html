          <p>When the Project was presented, we didn’t know what our bot was going to be. To be honest, I’m not really sure if we can define Koneko Bot as something. What I do know is that we wanted to create something useful and fun.</p>
<p>Koneko is a multifunctional discord bot. We chose Discord because it is a highly used platform and since it’s mostly for group chatting, having our extremely useful bot would make a difference. It has seven functions total: translator function, where the bot translates any word in any language; weather function, where the bot says the weather at the moment in any location; places function, where the robot says a certain type of place in a certain location; profanity decryptor, where the robot occults the swearwords he sends and every time the user says something inappropriate, the robot sends a message; cat function, function that sends facts and pictures of cats; dictionary function, where the robot says the meaning of a word and a directions function, where the robot says all the steps from going to a place to another. Each one of this functions is useful to the user because he can get informed using our bot. Well except for the cat function. That just sends pictures of random cats.</p>
<p>The function I developed was the “places function”. I used the Google Places API to develop the function. When the user inputs, for example, “show me restaurants in coventry”, the bot will output up to twenty results of restaurants in Coventry. In each of that result, it includes the name of the restaurant, the corresponding address and phone number, the rating, if it’s open at the moment and the opening hours of the establishment.</p>
<p>To do this, I had to get my API key in order to get access to the Google Places data via a json file. I had no idea what was a json file so it was a challenge. I searched for a json file url that had all the information I wanted and then I used that url to extract all the data. Then I just formatted it in my own way to make it “pretty” to the user. Sounds easy right? Not so much. As a person who never programmed more than “if statements” I felt really lost. It was hard to learn how dictionaries worked, what were dictionaries even and how would I extract data from them.</p>
<p>This project helped me develop my Python skills definitely but beyond that I developed some personal development skills, which I consider important to get a future job. First of all, I learned how to handle situations of stress more calmly. I get really stressed when I can’t do something and when it comes to coding, when the code doesn’t seem to work multiple times, it’s stressing. But everything ends up working out at the end. Another skill I gained was self-learning. I wasn’t used to do all of the work by myself, but with this project I had to learn everything from scratch. I learned how to implement an API from scratch, a thing I thought it was impossible. I can consider team work another skill I gained. I’ve worked in teams before but not when it comes to such a big project. The communication and the always be prepared to help the member of the team it’s not something we gain overnight but I definitely saw an improvement.</p>
<p>Talking about the difficulties of the project I encountered, our group didn’t communicate as much in the beginning but we then realized that constant and persistent communication in a project it’s very important if you wanted the project to be any good. At first, some people did the same function and had the same idea because there was no communication, for example and that slowed us down a little bit. In terms of code, as I mentioned, the most difficult part was learning how to implement an API from scratch on a short time.
To conclude my reflexion, I think our project is well-constructed and we ended up with a great chatbot that works properly and it’s fun to talk with. The way I see it, a project is never perfect or even completed. We can always add more and more but I’m glad we’re all happy with our “final” result.</p>
